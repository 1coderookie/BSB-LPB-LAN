***Here you find the command reference (so called 'cheatsheet') in different languages in a printer-friendly PDF-format.***  

If the cheatsheet isn't available in your language or if it's not yet translated and you are a native speaker of that 
specific language or you know someone who could help us with the translation, please feel free to create a pull request 
or use the 'empty' files "translation-template_command_ref.md" and "translation-template_command_ref.odt" to create the 
specific translated files and send them via email.  
  
**Thanks for your support!**
