# BSB-LPB-LAN
Here you can find the comprehensive manual in german language referring to the fantastic project "BSB-LPB-LAN".  
The project allows you to connect your BSB-/LPB-/PPS-based heating system (e.g. systems from Br√∂tje or Elco) to your LAN/computer via an adapter which you can build by your own.   
By using the web-interface of the BSB-LAN-software you can easily access, monitor and log different values and even control your heating system via the internet.  
Implementation to smarthome-systems (e.g. FHEM, openHAB, HomeMatic) can easily be realized via HTTPMOD or JSON.
All the informations, schemes and also the software you can find here: https://github.com/fredlcore/bsb_lan  
Kudos to all developers and users who are involved in this project!
